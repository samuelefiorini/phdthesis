Moreover, the posed optimization problems can have very different properties; they can be convex, non-convex, they can include differentiable as well as non-differentiable terms. A rigorous review of the most common optimization problems in ML is beyond the scope of this thesis and can be found here~\cite{boyd2004convex, bach2012optimization, sra2012optimization, nesterov2013introductory}.
